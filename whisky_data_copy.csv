Miyagikyo Aromatic Yeast - Nikka Discovery,Miyagikyo,Japan,Miyagikyo,Japanese Whisky,0.0,0.0,70,47,254.65,0,"Radiant, well-balanced. The full-bodied attack is at first refreshingly herbaceous (barley field, fern). Very delicately, the mid-palate then becomes wonderfully rich (brioche, leavened baguette). Next, white peaches and pears release their deliciously tangy juice onto the taste buds as acacia honey spreads voluptuously around the sides of the palate.","Long, silky. Closely linked to the end of the palate, incredibly fresh flavours of herbal tea (sage, camomile, verbena) cross through the start of the finish. At the end of the finish, grains of salt are placed gently onto a bed of cut grass. The mentholated, very slightly empyreumatic (smoking cigar) and spicy (fresh ginger) retro-nasal olfaction gradually reveals subtle floral notes (pear tree, lily of the valley). The empty glass releases fermentation aromas.","Refined, full of ardour. The very exuberant first nose (lavender, marshmallow, marsh mallow plant) is also softly liquoricey and lush (malted barley). Allowed to breathe, succulent perfumes of comtÃ© cheese, flowering meadow, and fruits (peach, pear, apricot) intensely take hold of the olfactory arena.

Yoichi Aromatic Yeast - Nikka Discovery,Yoichi,Japan,Yoichi,Japanese Whisky,0.0,0.0,70,48,254.65,0,"Firm, lively. Giving its own take on the herbaceous, salty and empyreumatic register of the first nose, the attack also evokes a field of barley swept with sea spray. The more earthy and rooted mid-palate pours blocks of peat onto the tongue. The floral (tulip, cyclamen) and fruity (Mirabelle plum, greengage plum) end of the palate is also rustic and marine.","Long, crisp. Unexpectedly, the start of the finish invites us to bite joyfully into whole bunches of white grapes. Flavours of plum and pulp bring lots of smoothness to the end of the palate. On the retro-nasal olfaction, evoking an evanescent peat, a fine layer of liquorice delicately coats the taste buds. The empty glass releases wisps of translucent smoke.","Fine, distinguished. On the first nose, a herbaceous, salty and empyreumatic (sleet) peat clearly dominates. Allowed to breathe, it makes way for fruits (apple, pear, Canary melon), flowers (lily, carnation) and mint, all of which bring lots of momentum to the aroma palette. Gradually, it becomes increasingly milky (cream, coconut), exotic (pineapple, yellow kiwi) and medicinal (ointment, Arnica).","(70cl, 48%)"
